This repository is my output from working on [hotrails.dev](https://www.hotrails.dev/).

You need to have: 
- [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/) running and available on port `5432`
- [Redis](https://redis.io) running and available on port `6379`

See [Makefile](https://github.com/Gary-H9/quote-editor/blob/main/Makefile) to get up and running.
