This repository is my output from working on [hotrails.dev](https://www.hotrails.dev/).

You need to have: 
- [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/) running and available on port `5432`
- [Redis](https://redis.io) running and available on port `6379`

See [Makefile](https://github.com/Gary-H9/quote-editor/blob/main/Makefile) to get up and running. 

## ðŸ““ Miscellaneous Notes 

### Adding Turbo

When creating controllers turn off turbo functionality to make sure they work properly before doing any improvement.

To disable Turbo functionality add the final two lines of code below to `app/javascript/application.js`.

```
// Entry point for the build script in your package.json
import "@hotwired/turbo-rails"
import "./controllers"

import { Turbo } from "@hotwired/turbo-rails"
Turbo.session.drive = false
```

### Commit History

My approach when doing this tutorial was to create a branch per chapter then rebase and merge all commits in that branch. For the most part, this allows me to look at the history of the project in detail in future.
