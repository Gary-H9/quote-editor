This repository is my output from working on [hotrails.dev](https://www.hotrails.dev/).

The only noteworthy configuration that you need is PostgreSQL running and available on port `5432`. You can probably run without using PostgreSQL but I can't confirm this until I've completed the tutorial. 

See [Makefile](https://github.com/Gary-H9/quote-editor/blob/main/Makefile) to get up and running.
